# üßë‚Äçüíª Professional Self-Assessment

## üëã Introduction

My name is **Erin Zamora**, and this ePortfolio represents the culmination of my journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. Over the course of the program, I‚Äôve developed skills in software design, data structures and algorithms, and database systems. This portfolio brings together those skills through a single enhanced artifact‚Äîmy Inventory App‚Äîwhich I‚Äôve improved across three technical domains to showcase my growth as a software developer.

## üß† Academic and Technical Growth

Through this program, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to apply computer science principles in real-world projects. I learned how to:

- Collaborate in team environments through shared development projects and version control
- Communicate technical information clearly via documentation, diagrams, and presentations
- Solve problems algorithmically using efficient, scalable code structures
- Design and build modular software systems that follow industry best practices
- Implement secure coding techniques and think critically about data protection

These skills have prepared me for success in both collaborative and independent technical work.

## üîç Specialization and Focus Areas

My primary focus has been on **full-stack development and mobile app design**, which aligns well with my Inventory App enhancement project. The enhancements I made demonstrate my proficiency in:

- **Software Engineering:** Restructuring code using modular patterns and clean architecture
- **Algorithms & Data Structures:** Applying sorting, searching, and filtering logic to manage app data
- **Databases:** Designing persistent, user-specific inventory tables and writing structured SQL queries

## üí¨ Reflection and Future Goals

Creating this portfolio helped me reflect on just how much I‚Äôve grown, not only in technical skill but in confidence. It also reinforced my ability to break down complex problems and improve software iteratively. Moving forward, I plan to pursue a career in software development, with a strong interest in mobile applications and backend systems.

I feel ready to contribute to development teams, continue learning, and embrace new technologies. This ePortfolio is a step toward demonstrating my qualifications to future employers and collaborators in the software industry.
