# 🧮 Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement

## 📦 Artifact: Inventory App

This enhancement focuses on improving data processing efficiency and internal operations in the Inventory App. It demonstrates thoughtful algorithm selection and structured data handling using collections and search functionality.

---

## 📁 What’s Included

- `InventorySearch.java`: Implements item search using optimized filtering and iteration  
- `ItemSorter.java`: Adds support for sorting inventory by name and quantity  
- `DataUtils.java`: Provides helper methods to process item lists using basic algorithmic logic

---

## 🎯 Enhancement Goals

- Improve performance of inventory filtering and sorting  
- Use appropriate data structures (e.g., lists, maps) for cleaner logic  
- Refactor logic-heavy tasks into reusable utility classes

---

## 💬 Reflection

This enhancement helped me apply algorithmic thinking to everyday software tasks. I practiced balancing performance with readability while using structures like lists and loops more effectively. This aligns with course outcomes focused on data structures and algorithm-based problem solving.
