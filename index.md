## 📝 About This Project

This capstone artifact represents the progress I’ve made throughout my computer science journey. By selecting a single comprehensive project—the Inventory App—and enhancing it across three core areas, I’ve demonstrated not only my technical skills but also my adaptability and problem-solving mindset as a software developer.
